# gilded_rose_kata
This repository contains both files of my refactoring of the Gilded Rose Kata. 
I first chose to refactor using python; the refactored python code is titled "gilded_rose.py".
For my second language to refactor is chose to use c++; the refactored c++ code is titled "gildedRose.cc".

I am quite familiar with python from previous classes in high school so I feel very good about my writing in python.
However, since I was unable to use java as my second language, I chose to try c++. Java and python are the only languages I was familiar with up until this project.
When I first looked at the c++ code I noticed that it looked very similar to java with some minor differences. 
I did my best to follow the syntax and still refactor just as well as I feel I did with python, but I may have made some mistakes due to my unfamiliarity with c++.

In this assigment one thing I changed was eliminating dupliate code with a function or method that was recalled multiple times.
Another was dividing the main updateQuality function/method into seperate functions/methods by reading the code and identifying what I thought each set of nested if's were actually doing.
I feel that my changes adhere to the Clean Code lessons we have learned thus far and make this program's code much more organized, easier to read, and efficient.
